# Vulnerability Management
_A lightweight, opinionated overview for demo purposes._

> [!tip]
> **TL;DR**  
> We continuously **discover**, **prioritize**, **remediate**, and **verify** vulnerabilities across in-scope assets.  
> SLAs are severity-based, roles are clear, and closure requires proof (re-scan/evidence).

## 1. Purpose & Scope
This section describes how our team handles software and infrastructure vulnerabilities across **production**, **staging**, and **developer** environments. It sets expectations for **roles**, **SLAs**, **evidence of closure**, and **exceptions**.  
> **Out of scope (example):** Third-party SaaS where we do not control patching—tracked as vendor risk, not internal remediation.

## 2. Principles
- **Risk-based:** We prioritize by impact and likelihood (CVSS/EPSS/KEV).  
- **Fast feedback:** Findings must flow quickly from detection → owner → action.  
- **Evidence first:** Every closure needs verification (scan result, config diff, test).  
- **Automation over heroics:** Prefer platform fixes, golden images, and policy as code.  
- **Least privilege:** Limit blast radius; approve only necessary access for remediation.

> [!important]
> **No secrets in trackers or wiki.** Use the approved secrets vault. Link, don’t paste.

## 3. Definitions
- **Finding:** An identified vulnerability (scanner, advisory, manual).  
- **Asset:** A host, container image, app, library, device, or cloud resource.  
- **Owner:** The accountable team/person for remediation.  
- **Validation:** Re-scan or alternate proof demonstrating effective fix/mitigation.  
- **Exception:** Time-bound approval to defer or not apply a fix, with compensating controls.

## 4. Roles & Responsibilities (RACI excerpt)
| Activity                    | Security (SecOps) | Service Owner | Platform/SRE | Change Mgr |
|----------------------------|-------------------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| Intake & de-dup            | **R**             | C             | C            | I          |
| Triage (risk/impact)       | **A**             | **R**         | C            | I          |
| Remediation planning       | C                 | **A/R**       | **R**        | C          |
| Change approval            | I                 | R             | R            | **A**      |
| Validation & closure       | **A**             | **R**         | C            | I          |
**Legend:** A=Accountable, R=Responsible, C=Consulted, I=Informed

> [!note]
> Each finding must have a named **Owner**, **Due date**, and **Environment** label.

## 5. Severity & SLAs (example)
We use severity to set **maximum time to remediate** (TTR). “Clock” starts when the owner is assigned.

| Severity | Description (examples)                          | SLA (Prod) | SLA (Non-Prod) |
|---------:|--------------------------------------------------|-----------:|---------------:|
| Critical | KEV/actively exploited; internet-exposed RCE     | 7 days     | 14 days        |
| High     | Likely exploitation; auth bypass; data exposure  | 14 days    | 30 days        |
| Medium   | Limited exploitability; local or low impact      | 45 days    | 60 days        |
| Low      | Hard to exploit; negligible business impact      | 90 days    | 120 days       |

> [!warning]
> **KEV / Zero-day:** If a finding appears on a “known exploited” list or has active exploitation, treat as **Critical** regardless of base score.
