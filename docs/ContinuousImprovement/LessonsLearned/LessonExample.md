## Context
What problem were we trying to solve? Who cared, and why now? One paragraph.

## Objective
The concrete outcome we needed (e.g., “reduce false positives by 30% within one sprint”).

## What we tried
Short bullets of the approaches attempted. Include failed paths (they save time for others).

## What finally worked
The winning approach. Include key config snippets/queries/commands.

## Pitfalls & anti-patterns
Gotchas that cost time. Be explicit (“don’t set X with Y; it breaks Z”).

## Outcome & impact
What changed (MTTR, noise, SLA compliance, audit pass, cost, stability). Quantify if possible.

## Reusable artifacts
- Script / query / config (link or inline)
- Dashboard / report (link)
- Checklist / SOP (link)

## Next steps
Follow-ups, backlog items, or ideas to generalize/automate.

## Credits
